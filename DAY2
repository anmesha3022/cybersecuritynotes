some types of Adapter:
1.NAT: Allows the VM to access the external network using the host's IP address.

2.Bridged Adapter: Connects the VM directly to the physical network as if it's another device on the same LAN.

3.Internal Network: Allows communication only between VMs on the same internal network.

4.Host-only Adapter: Creates a network between the host and the VM only, without external access.

5.Generic Driver: Enables custom network setups using third-party drivers or protocols.

6.NAT Network: Similar to NAT but allows communication between VMs on the same network.

7.Cloud Network [EXPERIMENTAL]: Provides experimental support for cloud-based networking features.
